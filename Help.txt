Welcome to MarineTox Predictor
MarineTox Predictor, was developed by integrating multi-task deep learning with cross-domain knowledge-sharing mechanism, to facilitate end-to-end prediction of 24 saltwater toxicity tasks for 20 organisms spanning algae, crustaceans, invertebrates, mollusks and fish.

1. Which data is included?
-Estimated ecotoxicity data of 20 marine species for approximately 68,000 chemicals
-Species sensitivity curves for 68,000 chemicals
-Hazardous concentration for 5% of the species for 68,000 chemicals

2. How to Search data?
- Go to the left sidebar
- Select search type: Chemical name/SMILES/Molecular formula
- You can directly type in the search box for exact matching or select from the dropdown list of existing chemicals

3. Notes
-Only exact matches will return results
-If no data is found, double-check spelling or try other search types
